# Taxonomy of constraints
In the [complete table](complete_table_of_results.pdf), a detailed description is attached to make the taxonomy of constraints more clear.
Each convention may involve different constraints, which is marked in the column of the convention (except the last two rows, which contain the results of capability evaluation on this convention).
For example, in Android framework *"layout link: content view"* refers to a convention that links the layout file with the layout resource, which is usually referenced in the *Activity* setting method or the context of it, such as:

<div align=center><img src="img/layout_link.png" width=600px /></div>

Apparently, the content of the layout file will be stored in the resource by its file name and the layout resource can be referenced with a prefix `R.layout.`. As a result, this convention involves a constraint on the naming of the layout resource identifier as well as the relationship between the naming of the layout resource identifier and the layout file. So we marked two constraints in the column of convention *layout link: content view*: 
- the *independent-naming-prefix/suffix* constraint.
- the *inter-related-naming-prefix/suffix change* constraint.
# Explanation of bad cases

## Conventions not supported
All of the 6 conventions not supported by Focus DSL have a same feature that any of them is a non-enumerable set of concrete code patterns. This is because these conventions usually involve execution of expressions or nested iteration of method invocations. As a result, we can't define a generic rule to conclude them. For example, this is a code snippet of convention *parameter field link* in Mybatis framework:

<div align=center><img src="img/field.png" width=600px /></div>

In this example, `#{user.id}` refers to the member field `id` of the object `user` (which is a member field of the class `SessionData`) and `#{user.icon.url}` refers to the member field `url` of the object `icon` (which is a member field of the object `user`). The two identifiers are similar in the format, only different in the depth of member field access. However, since all possible depths of different instances of this convention theoretically compose a non-enumerable set containing infinite numbers of elements, it's impossible to define rules to express it perfectly with Focus DSL.
While in theory Focus DSL can't express such conventions due to lack of enumerability, in practice some of them can be reduced to a limited set, e.g. in the above example, we can assume that the depth of member field access is less than 6 since more deep nesting is usually avoided by the developers to guarantee the readability of the code. In this case, we can define rules to cover most of the practical scenarios with Focus DSL.

## The convention partially supported
The only convention partially supported by Focus DSL is *id link: view binding*.
In some condition, this convention involves the position information of siblings in the context, which is not supported in Focus DSL.
For example, when there are more than one *view binding* objects with the same name in the same class, we may need position information of elements in the context to reason about the scope of the target identifier, determining which view the target identifier is bound to. It's also the reason why constraints related to sibling elements are marked as partially supported.

# Comparison to the baseline
## Examples of Focus and baseline
Express *id link: resource access* with QVT/R-Link:
<div align=left><img src="img/qvtr.png" width=900px /></div>

Express *id link: resource access* with Focus:
<div align=left><img src="img/focus.png" width=300px /></div>

## Expressiveness
Based on a powerful model transformation specification, QVT/R-Link (with designed meta-models for involved languages) shows a good ability to specify certain patterns, but QVT/R-Link also has limits in specifying some constraints, especially context-related constraints.
Compared to QVT/R-Link, Focus DSL shows a better ability in specifying the nested layers of the ancestors and siblings of identifiers, since in Focus DSL we can directly write the template of a URI to represent necessary hierarchical information  around an identifier, while QVT/R-Link can only specify ancestors and siblings by iteratively declaring the parent of identifiers, which usually fail to meet the need for expressing flexible hierarchical information.

For example, in convention *view link: return value(static)*, the return value which represents the relative path of the bound view is linked to the corresponding view file, e.g. return value `"admin/blog/index"` linked to the file `"src/main/templates/admin/blog/index.html"`. In QVT/R-Link, the file path is modeled as a path in a tree where each node represents a directory or a file, but it's hard to parse a string literal into this kind of organized structure in QVT/R-Link.

## Conciseness
In conciseness, Focus DSL also outperforms QVT/R-Link since Focus DSL is a concisely organized language designed for XLL specification while QVT/R-Link is based on an elaborate language QVT/R which is for other purpose.
Focus DSL adopts *YAML* as the base language, using `list` and `dictionary` to organize data, which is suitable to describe the *URI* model, while QVT/R-Link uses a object-oriented format where the context information can only be described in the form of a property in the object of the corresponding identifier.

For example, in QVT/R-Link, we need to wrap key information in multiple brackets to express the hierarchical information like `parent=o:object{name="A", parent=oo:object{name="B"â€¦}}`, which can be easily expressed in Focus DSL by `.../B/A`.

## Generalization
In the ability of generalization, Focus DSL cost much less to be generalized to other frameworks and projects, since it applies a generic model *URI* which can be adapted to most programming languages, while extra overhead of designing meta models for all new languages is required to apply QVT/R-Link in new frameworks.
Meta models contain more directive information strongly bound to some of the conventions, but can lead to a burden of designing and extra overhead to be generalized to other frameworks and projects.
For example, in [the provided code examples](#examples-of-focus-and-baseline), we can see many of the classes are defined especially to express this XLL: 
- class `Activity` refers to the layouts referenced in the form of`R.layout.layout_name`(in this case, the value of `referencedLayout` should be `layout_name`)
- class `LayoutReference` refers to the widgets referenced in the form of `R.id.widget_id`(in this case, the value of `referenceId` should be `widget_id`, the value of `activity` should be an instance of class `Activity` which is the layout this widget belongs to).

Instances of them need to be extracted specifically in the implementation, and this model also makes some assumptions, e.g. the `activity` value of `LayoutReference` instances can always be extracted accurately, which are sometimes not true.
On the other hand, in Focus, source code in different languages from different frameworks can be adapted to the *URI* model naturally and generically since the *URI* is essentially an enhanced tree structure, which is simpler but more flexible than the meta models in QVT/R-Link.
